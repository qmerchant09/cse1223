/*
 * Project12.java
 *
 *   A program that tests the SimpleClock class.  This program instantiates a
 *   new SimpleClock object, sets it to 11:59:00PM and then repeatedly ticks
 *   seconds to show the passage of an hours worth of time.  YOU DO NOT NEED
 *   TO MODIFY THIS CLASS.  Make your modifications to the SimpleClock.java
 *   file instead.
 *
 *   See the write-up for Project 12 for more details.
